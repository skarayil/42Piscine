# \"\\\?\$\*\'MaRViN\'\*\$\?\\\"

> Target: Knowing how to work with special characters.

To create files with special characters you need to put `\` before the character.
For double quotes `" `You need to use two `\\ `. The file can only have 2 bytes. For the file made in the cat having just 2 bytes just press` ctrl+d` twice.
```bash
cat > \"\\\?\$\*\'MaRViN\'\*\$\?\\\"
42
```
