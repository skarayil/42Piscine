# Rush 02

In this project we will create a program that receives a number and return the number name by writing. All files are commented for a better understanding.

## Instructions

It's necessary to compile the files together to run. In this project we will compile the files using a makefile. Use the command below:

```bash
make all
```
Then run the executable with this parameter:
```bash
./rush-01 2453 #The output should be: two thousand four hundred fifty three
```
## Final grade: Not started :x:
I didn't subscribe to this project during the Piscine period. All exercises were done after the Piscine end to consolidate knowledge. These exercises didn't have the validation of Moulinette.
