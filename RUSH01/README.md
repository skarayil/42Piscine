# Rush 01

In this project we will create a program that receives the clues for Skyscrappers's Puzzle and prints the solution. All files are commented for a better understanding.

## Instructions

It's necessary to compile the files together to run. To compile the files directly in terminal, Use the command below:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c -o rush-01
```
Then run the executable with this parameter:
```bash
./rush-01 "4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2" | cat -e
```
## Final grade: Not started :x:
I didn't subscribe to this project during the Piscine period. All exercises were done after the Piscine end to consolidate knowledge. These exercises didn't have the validation of Moulinette.
